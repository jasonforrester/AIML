This project applies AI-driven data science methods to analyze coupon acceptance rates based on driver behavior and passenger attributes. The objective is to identify patterns in coupon acceptance, particularly focusing on bar and restaurant coupons, by leveraging a dataset that includes demographic details of drivers, trip contexts, and coupon types.

Objective:
The main goal of this analysis is to predict which groups of drivers are most likely to accept specific coupons, using features such as age, income, trip destination, and passenger type. This project employs AI methodologies, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, to derive actionable insights.

Data Overview:
The dataset used for this analysis contains multiple feature categories:

User Attributes: Age, gender, income, marital status, education level, occupation, and number of children.
Contextual Attributes: Trip destination (home, work, or other), weather conditions, and passengers present in the vehicle.
Coupon Attributes: Type of coupon (Bar, Restaurant, Takeaway, etc.) and time to coupon expiration.
AI Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning: Missing values were handled appropriately by excluding incomplete records to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Drivers were categorized into different groups based on their behavior, such as frequency of bar visits and income level. Labels were also created to represent coupon acceptance tendencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summaries were generated to understand the distribution of key features.
Acceptance rates for each demographic group were calculated, and correlation analysis was performed to detect relationships between coupon types and driver attributes.
Feature Grouping & Segmentation:

Grouped drivers based on bar visit frequency, age, occupation, and passenger type.
Segmented data to compare coupon acceptance rates across various demographics and behavioral patterns.
Data Visualization:

Data was visualized using bar plots, count plots, and heatmaps to reveal trends and outliers in coupon acceptance. These visualizations helped in understanding which factors had the strongest influence on coupon redemption.
Key Insights Derived:

Frequent Bar Visitors: Drivers who go to bars more than once per month exhibit a higher probability of accepting bar-related coupons.
Age Influence: Younger drivers (under 30) are significantly more likely to redeem coupons.
Passenger Effect: Drivers with adult passengers (excluding children) are more likely to use coupons.
Income Sensitivity: Lower-income drivers (below $50,000) show a greater tendency to accept certain types of coupons.
Trip Destination: Drivers without an urgent destination show a higher rate of coupon acceptance, especially compared to those commuting to work or home.
Tools and Libraries:
The project leverages Pythonâ€™s pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, numpy for numerical operations, and the analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

By applying this structured AI methodology, the project identifies key behavioral and demographic drivers of coupon acceptance, providing insights that can guide targeted coupon marketing strategies.
